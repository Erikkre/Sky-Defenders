         - all slaves from slave traders will benefit from the colonist training and diet program.
         - 50% more walk speed for all colonist who benefit from training.
         - Remember only the 3 orig starting colonist and slaves from slave traders,
           will benefit from the 50% more walk speed, training, and the diet program.

v3.2     - Artillery accuracy decreased, explosion radius and damage increased.
