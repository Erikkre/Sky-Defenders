    <description>A single-person energy shield device. This one is of low quality and is put together with crude construction techniques. It will attempt to stop any rapidly-moving projectile or energy attack that comes from a distance. It does nothing against melee attacks or shots from point-blank range. It also prevents firing past touch range.(Note: works the same as core game sheildbelts, will prevent ranged characters from shooting if equiped. does not protect against melee attacks)</description>

A large smiling face encompasses the center of the medallion and their are engravings on the back "Von vielen, kommt man".
